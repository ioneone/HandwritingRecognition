# HandwritingRecognition
I used three different methods that recognize pictures of a number (in the format of 28x28 PNG file).

# Implementation
I summarized how I did it here (Coming soon...)
# Accuracy
* Distance Method: 81.55%
* Angle Method:    82.16%
* Neural Network:  94.62%

# Reference
1. Distance Method (Chapter 4 of When Life is Linear by Tim Chartier)
2. [Neural Network](https://github.com/ioneone/NeuralNetwork)
3. [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) (I did not upload mnist_train.csv because the file was too big)
